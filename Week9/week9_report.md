## I(a)

The zip file was download and extracted. I then ran gpt.py but this took an unreasonable length of time to run as it was running on the CPU. Since I have an AMD GPU I had to instal ROCm to run the code on the GPU. I then ran the code again and it ran much faster.\
Now that the environment was setup I changed the code to take the file path as a command line argument and ran the code pointing at the input_childSpeech_trainingSet.txt data set. A print message was also added to print the vocabulary size of the
dataset wich was 40. This was run for the two other datasets as well. The childSpeechTest dataset also had a vocabulary size of 40 while the shakespeare dataset had a vocabulary size of 65.
